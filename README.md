Codes for traing and analising Dynamic Network Connectivity Predictor model.

This codebase accompanies the paper "Discovery of latent dynamic connectivity in brain cortical networks from massive spiking data" 
Colin Gaber, Yurii Vlasov, and Alexander Schwing

It is a probabilistic model to discover the dynamic connectivity structure in a network of spiking cortical neurons. 
The model is designed to mine large-scale recordings of spiking activity in the brain. The model learns the latent dynamic functional interactions in brain networks.
