##DyNetCP
Dynamic Network Connectivity Predictor - the unsupervised latent variable model. 
#It is a probabilistic model to discover the dynamic connectivity structure in a network of spiking cortical neurons. 
The model is designed to mine large-scale recordings of spiking activity in the brain. The model learns the latent dynamic functional interactions in brain networks.
